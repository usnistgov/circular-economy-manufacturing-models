note: The Production in a Circular Economy (CE) model consists of
  five life cycle activities (Design Product, Acquire Materials, Produce Product,
  Use and Consume, and Treat at End of Life) that are consistent with manufacturing
  economic models. Using the IDEFâˆ… functional modeling method, relevant inputs, outputs,
  controls, and mechanisms for each activity are defined. The five activities are
  described at a high level. The Circular Product Design model describes
  the Design Product activity of the CE model in depth, providing examples that are
  relevant for designing in a circular economy. Further research on downstream activities
  (Acquire Materials, Produce Product, Use and Consume, and Treat at End of Life)
  is ongoing and these activities may be missing detailed descriptions within the
  model.

 The Circular Product Design (CPD) Activity Model is a model of the activities and systems involved in designing for circularity. 
CPD is an approach that enables designers to facilitate the creation of products for a circular economy (CE) and promotes value retention and resource efficiency that can lead to economic, environmental, and social benefits (i.e., the triple bottom line). 
A key need for CPD is to leverage data from downstream life cycle stages to inform design decisions both initially and iteratively. 
The CPD Activity Model outlines design activities and the data to be collected from each other stage of the product lifecycle as it relates to design activities. 
Users of the CPD model can include CE researchers, product designers, and standards development bodies, among others. The model serves as a resource to:
 <ul>
  <li>
   Identify differences in data needs and considerations for CPD practices, compared to traditional product design practices
  </li>
  <li>
   Identify areas within CPD that require further development of tools, measurement methods, or standards
  </li>
  <li>
   Determine the data collection necessary to guide design decisions
  </li>
  <li>
   Assess the potential downstream impacts of design decisions
  </li>
  <li>
   Plan for information tracking throughout a product&acirc;&euro;&trade;s life cycle
  </li>
 </ul>
 The figure shows Inputs, Outputs, Controls, and Mechanisms for Design Product activity as they relate to other activities within the broader Production in a CE model. Data from other product life cycle stages that should be considered during the design activity are marked with (X).
