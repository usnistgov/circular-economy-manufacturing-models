   Description
  </b>
 </p>
 Information gained from prior iterations of the product
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Examples:
 <br/>
 - Previously released versions: How the product was produced; How the product was used; How the product was treated at end-of-life
 <br/>
 - Previous "Design Change Requests" (from manufacturing): Information about requests from downstream engineering activities feeding back to design activities for changes to the part design [2]
