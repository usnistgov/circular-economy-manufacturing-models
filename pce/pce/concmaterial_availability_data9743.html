   Description
  </b>
 </p>
 Information on the materials available to be used for the product
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Examples:
  <br/>
 - Detailed breakdown of materials used [59]
 <br/>
 - Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of materials and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) [59]
 <br/>
 - Information about material properties from suppliers: Material strength; Material durability; Material recyclability; Material biodegradability; Material sourcing (e.g., recovered or renewable, sustainably sourced or produced resources) [59]; Virgin vs. recycled content [59]
 <br/>
 - Information about new material technologies: Bio-based food packaging (e.g., seaweed-based) [17]; New carbon materials for renewable energy systems [18]
 <br/>
 - "Tooling/materials availability" (from manufacturing): Response to preparation orders indicating expected times of availability of the requested tooling and materials [2]
 <br/>
 - Market demand for material: Recycled plastic supply [19]; Critical metals for EVs [20]
 <br/>
 - Industrial symbiosis: Byproduct-exchange partnerships between firms to source materials or energy [21]
